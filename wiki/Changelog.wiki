*0.9.5* 
  * Fixed problem caused by removing quotes from tag attributes before "`/>`". See [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=20 this issue] for details.
  * Added JUnit tests to the zip bundle


*0.9.4* 
  * Improved extra space removal around conditional comments. See [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=16#c4 this issue] for details.
  * Compressor taglib TLD file is now bundled with JAR file to eliminate unnecessary web.xml configuration in JSP 2.0 and above (TLD can still be downloaded as separated file for older versions). See [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=19 this issue] for details.
  * Command line compressor now has more clear error message if required YUI compressor jar file is missing. See [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=17#c3 this issue] for details.

*0.9.3* 
  * Fixed issue with conditional comments. See [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=16 this issue] for details.
  * Because of the changes in v.0.9.2 related to `ErrorReporter`, YUI compressor dependency has become mandatory. In this release this dependency was made optional again,  but at a cost of moving default `ErrorReporter` implementation into external class `DefaultErrorReporter` (see front page for usage example). If no `ErrorReporter` is provided, a null pointer exception will be thrown in case of an error in JavaScript.
  
  
*0.9.2* 
  * Added ability to set custom preservation rules for HTML compressor by using `setPreservePatterns()` method (see the front page for usage examples)
  * Implemented default `ErrorReporter` for YUI compressor that would output any errors during JavaScript compression to `System.err` stream (it used to throw null pointer exceptions in case of JavaScript error). You can also provide your own `ErrorReporter` implementation by using `setYuiErrorReporter()` method (see javadocs for details)

*0.9.1* 
  * Fixed problem with JavaScript blocks wrapped with CDATA not being compressed. See [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=8 this issue] for details.

*0.9* 
  * Inline event handlers (`onclick`,`onload`, etc) now are getting preserved similar to `<pre>`,`<script>` and others, as they might contain javascript that will break tag boundaries detection. 
  * Added space removal around equals sign inside tags (`<p id = "p1">` => `<p id="p1">`) to default behavior for HTML and XML compressors.
  * Multiple spaces inside XML tags replaced with single spaces as default behavior.
  * Improved tag preserving algorithm for `<pre>`,`<script>` and others to preserve only their content, so these tags themselves are treated as regular tags and getting compressed where appropriate (it used to preserve both content and tags).


*0.8.2*
  * Added ending space removal inside tags (`<br /><p >` => `<br/><p>`) to default behavior for HTML and XML compressors.


*0.8*
  * Added ability to call HTML and XML compressors from a command line. Please see the front page for details.

*0.7.2*
  * [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=3 Bug fix]

*0.7.1*
  * [http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=2 Bug fix]

*0.7*
  * Performance tweaks

*0.6*
  * Improved algorithm of removing unnecessary quotes from tag attributes for `HtmlCompressor` so there is no performance impact when enabled (`setRemoveQuotes(true)`)

*0.5*
  * Added Velocity compressor directives `#compressHtml`, `#compressXml`, `#compressJs`, `#compressCss` that allow compressing selected blocks within Velocity templates. Directives support all attributes from corresponding compressor classes.
  * Fixed bug with not preserving conditional IE comments in html (`<!--[if IE]><![endif]-->`) when `removeComments` is `true`

*0.4*
  * Added `removeIntertagSpaces` parameter to HTML compressor that will remove inter-tag whitespaces (default is `false`)
  * Added `removeComments` parameter to HTML and XML compressors to control comments removal (default is `true`, was always on in previous releases)
  * Added `removeMultiSpaces` parameter to HTML compressor to control removal of multiple whitespace characters (default is `true`, was always on in previous releases)
  * Taglib compressor tags now support all attributes from corresponding compressor classes, so you have full control over compression parameters from both java and jsp.
  * Added new jsp tags `<compress:js>` and `<compress:css>` that will call YUI Compressor directly (these tags also support attributes)
  * Added `enabled` parameter to HTML and XML compressors which will completely bypass any compression if set to `false` (default is `true`)
  * Dependency libs are now included in the source package, JAR file is made Java 5 compatible.

*0.3*
  * Added `removeQuotes` parameter to HTML compressor that will remove unnecessary quotes from tag attributes (dafault is `false`)
  * Performance tweaks

*0.2*
  * Added XmlCompressor
  * Created JSP taglib for <compress:html> and <compress:xml> tags

*0.1*
  * Initial release
