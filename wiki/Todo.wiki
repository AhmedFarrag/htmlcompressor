#labels Phase-Design
Ideas for improvements that require brainstorming:

  * Get rid of recursion in conditional comments
  * Better choice of output stream (`System.out` vs `System.error`) for command line compressor to separate compression results from error reports and help screens
  * Better exception handling in java api. Should compression throw any exceptions or catch them?
  * Look into error logging (java.util.logging, log4j, slf4j bridge?)
  * Look into possibility of creating complex js/css/html compression solution that produces googleplus-like compression results ([http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/issues/detail?id=46 shrinking css classes])
